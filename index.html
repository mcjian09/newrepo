<p>SDG #16 Myanmar: Research Paper</p>

<p>Background Information</p>

<p> The United Nations is an international organization established following the end of World War II with the goal of maintaining international peace and security, along with protecting human rights and delivering humanitarian aid. In 2015, the United Nations established a set of 17 goals and 169 targets to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure better living conditions for everyone. These goals and targets are considered Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The SDG I chose to research is #16, which is Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions.  Sustainable Development Goal #16 promotes &quot;peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.&quot; This crisis is most prevalent in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, especially due to the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Myanmar has been in a constant state of conflict since winning its independence from Great Britain in 1948. In Myanmar, several ethnic groups have continuously fought against Myanmar's armed forces for self determination. Aung San, the leader of the State of Burma, successfully negotiated with the United Kingdom for their independence. He reached an agreement between the Chin, Kachin, and Shan leaders, which promised full autonomy for the areas inhabited by the ethnic minorities. However, upon his assassination in 1947, the agreement was not honored. Following 3 successive parliamentary governments, Myanmar's military, the Tatmadaw, led by Ne Win, ousted the parliamentary government in a coup d'etat and replaced it with a military government, angering the ethnic minorities. In 1988, student demonstrations led to the 8888 Uprising, resulting in the overthrow of Ne Win's military dictatorship in a coup d'etat. The new military junta arranged a general election in 1990 to elect members to draft a new constitution. Led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of Aung San, the National League for Democracy won a supermajority of more than 80% of the seats. However, the military junta refused to recognize the results and placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. The Tatmadaw introduced a new constitution in 2008 and allowed political reforms from 2011 through 2015, and set up a civilian government, which was led by the National League for Democracy.</p>

<p>Past Action</p>

<p> Many international groups have sought to defuse the Myanmar conflict with varying degrees of success. One of the main peacekeeping groups is the United Nations, which first adopted Myanmar to the council's agenda in September 2006. Since then, they have tried multiple times to end the conflict. For instance, the United Nations has made multiple resolutions regarding the situation in Myanmar. In 2016, they documented multiple cases of ethnic cleansing and condemned the government. In addition, a draft resolution to the conflict in Myanmar was proposed in 2007 by letting in humanitarian aid and giving more rights to ethnic minorities, but was ultimately rejected by Russia and China.  In 2022, the United Nations issued a resolution that sought to immediately end all forms of violence in Myanmar, release political prisoners, restore democratic processes, and start negotiations with other countries. However, the Myanmar ruling military, the Tatmadaw, refused to accept the United Nations demands, and the conflict still continues. In April 2024, the United Nations once again released a resolution whose goal was to reduce the jet fuel provided to Myanmar, however Russia and China both dissented against it. The United Nations and other international aid organizations have been unable to provide humanitarian aid to Myanmar due to the dangerous conflict that has continuously been going on, which explains their urgency at ending the conflict.  One of the major opponents of the Myanmar Tatmadaw is the National League for Democracy, which was led by Aung San Suu Kyi. She rose to prominence following the 8888 uprisings, which had the popular support of the people in the 1990 elections and 2011 civilian government. Like her father Aung San, she sought to give more rights and liberties to the minorities of Myanmar, including the Kachin and Karen ethnic groups. However, because of her opposition to the military government, she has spent more than 2 decades in house arrest, and after her arrest in 2021, has been sentenced to decades in prison.   Country Accountability</p>

<p> The conflict in Myanmar is mainly fueled by the ethnic differences. The majority ethnic group in Myanmar is the Bamar, who comprise 69% of the population, the Karen, who make up 6.7%, and several smaller ethnic groups. Ever since Myanmar won independence from Great Britain in 1948, the ethnic minorities of Myanmar have been vying for independence or more rights. However, the ruling military of Myanmar, the Tatmadaw, has refused and continues to deny them rights and self determination, which is the main cause of the conflict.</p>

<p>Personal Advocacy    Since previous attempts by the United Nations have proved unsuccessful, I believe that the United Nations should send a peacekeeping delegation to Myanmar in an attempt to reduce the hostilities and make it safe for humanitarian aid to enter Myanmar. If this does not work, the United Nations should consider deploying troops to Myanmar to reduce the hostilities until an agreement can be worked out.</p>
